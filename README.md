# DrawNovelCharacters
The following project takes the text version of novel and imagines how its main characters might look.
This is my first ML project so it's not perfect.
This code will work on books that have good visual descriptions of their characters.
It might need changes based on novels you upload.
As you'll see stable diffusion gets confused with colors, so the visuals of characters might not be perfect, but we can still get our desired result if we generate three or four images of each character.
