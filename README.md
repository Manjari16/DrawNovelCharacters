# DrawNovelCharacters
This project takes the text version of novel and extracts physical features of its main characters. It uses Stable Diffusion to take the prompts with extracted features to generate visual representation of the characters. This code will work on books/novels that have good visual descriptions of their characters. It might need changes based on novels you upload.

As you'll see stable diffusion gets confused with colors, so the visuals of characters might not be perfect, but we can still get our desired result if we generate three or four images of each character.

Here are the images generated for my self-authored book 'Fat Keily':
